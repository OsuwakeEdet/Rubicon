// we operate on our variable, the operators used:

// arithmetic operator
// assignment operator
// comparison operator
// logical operator
// bitwise operator
// they are fundamental building blocks for applications

// for arithmetic operators we have addition +, subtraction -, division / , multiplicatiion *, modular % operators
