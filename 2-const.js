// "let" keyword is the best way to create variables that their values can be changed 
// the "const" keyword creates variables whose values can't, e.g

const CHRISTMAS_2024= "25.12.2024";
console.log(CHRISTMAS_2024);

// use the snake case convention for naming constants, it's like the previous naming convention but this uses uppercase for all the letters in all the words 
// AND YOU HAVE TO SEPERATE EACH WORD WITH AN UNDERSCORE e.g

const COLOR_GREEN = "green";

// the "const" keyword is used for variables whose values can never be changed or reassigned throughout the program
// note: IF YOU TRY TO REASSIGN A VARIABLE WITH THE CONST KEYWORD, IT WILL GIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE
// note: GIVE YOUR VARIABLES DESCRIPTIVE BUT SHORT NAMES TO PROVIDE CONTEXT
